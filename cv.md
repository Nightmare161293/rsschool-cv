I am a novice developer with a great desire and interest to work in the field of IT. My main distinguishing abilities are quick self-education, attentiveness to details, the ability to think analytically, make decisions independently and bear responsibility for them.).

I have basic knowledge in development using HTML, CSS languages. I use GIT to store repositories on Github hosting. I started studying Java-Script. At the moment I do not have a portfolio, but I am working on it. To do this, I signed up for RSSchool on JavaScript / Front-end Course
